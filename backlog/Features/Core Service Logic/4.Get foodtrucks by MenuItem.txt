As a developer I want an endpoint to get all the food trucks out of SFO with the name of a business so that the output is generated in a JSON with the food trucks near the location queried

AC:

given: I am an authenticated user
when: I request food trucks with a menu item
then: I should get an output of all the food trucks with the inputed name of the menu item

given: I requested the food trucks with the menu item candy
when: viewing the JSON output 
then: I should see the dayhours, fooditems, lat and long, and the Business name of the food truck in the output

Example:
Curl: 'https://www.funchallange.com/foodtrucks/FoodItems/candy/'	
Response: 200
Sample output:

{ "foodtrucks" : [
{ 	"dayshours":"Fri/Sat/Sun:10AM-6PM",
        "FoodItems": "Cold Truck: Sandwiches: fruit: snacks: candy: hot and cold drinks"
        "Lat":37.7665109269083
        "Long":-122.40926014493
	"BBName":"M M Catering"
        "PermitStatus":"Approved"
        "uuid": 26
},
...]
}
