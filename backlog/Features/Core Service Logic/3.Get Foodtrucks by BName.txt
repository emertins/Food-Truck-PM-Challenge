As a developer I want an endpoint to get all the food trucks out of SFO so that the output is generated in a JSON with the food trucks near the location queried

AC:

given: I am an authenticated user
when: I request trucks within 5 mile location
then: I should get an output of at least 5 food trucks near my location

given: I requested the food trucks near my location
when: viewing the JSON output 
then: I should see the dayhours, fooditems, lat and long, and the Business name of the food truck in the output

Example:
Curl: 'https://www.funchallange.com/foodtrucks/bname?=TestTruck1
Sample output:

{ "foodtrucks" : [
{ 	"dayshours":"Fri/Sat/Sun:10AM-6PM",
        "FoodItems": "Cold Truck: Sandwiches: fruit: snacks: candy: hot and cold drinks"
        "Lat":37.7678524427181
        "Long":-122.416104892532
	"BBName":"TestTruck1"
        "PermitStatus":"Approved"
        "uuid": 1
},
...]
}


given: I am an authenticated user
when: I request trucks within 5 mile location AND there is less than 5 food trucks
then: I should output the number of at least 5 food trucks outside of the 5 mile perimeter
