As a developer I want an endpoint to get all the trucks out of SFO so that the output is generated in a JSON output


given: I am an authenticated user
when: I request all the trucks from SFO using the GET method from the /footrucks endpoint
then: I should get an output of all the food trucks in SFO which include UUID, lat and long in decimal notation , permit=approved, hours, food items,  and names of the food truck in JSON format


Example:
Curl: http://www.funchallange.com/footrucks
Response: 200
Sample output:

{ "foodtrucks" : [
{ 	"dayshours":"Fri/Sat/Sun:10AM-6PM",
        "FoodItems": "Cold Truck: Sandwiches: fruit: snacks: candy: hot and cold drinks"
        "Lat":37.7678524427181
        "Long":-122.416104892532
	"BBName":"TestTruck1"
        "uuid": 1
},
...]
}
