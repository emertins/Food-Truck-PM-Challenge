as a developer I want to add a post method to the /foodtrucks endpoint so that I can add or update a food truck to the collection



curl -x POST
-H "Content-Type:application/JSON"
-d '{ 	"dayshours":"Fri/Sat/Sun:10AM-6PM",
        "FoodItems": "Cold Truck: Sandwiches: fruit: snacks: candy: hot and cold drinks"
        "Lat":37.7678524427181
        "Long":-122.416104892532
	"BBName":"New Truck"
}
'https://www.funchallange.com/foodtrucks'


Note for expediency the story will use the PUT method to update any previous entries. 

Given I need to enter a food truck into the DB
When: I enter the food truck information
then: I should requred to enter daysours,fooditems,LAT,LONT,BBName if not the API will reject the entry

Note that this endpoint will also support large number of records as it will be used in the Swagger page
