Since the core API was built without a control to update the DB directly 
this administration functionlity will serve the following

1) Create a new user type and assign it a role of Administrator
2) Create the ability for the new role to manipulate the api directly to do CRUD operations ( Create, Read, Update, Delete) all items in the food truck database
This administration functionality will convert the .CSV file output and do a transform on the .csv on the data model being used. 

This user story will serve to do the above.
