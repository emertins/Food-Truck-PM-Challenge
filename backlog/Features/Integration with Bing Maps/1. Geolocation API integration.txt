The food truck by location API will make restful calls to the bing API endpoint 
When providing the lat and long to the geolocation api from bing maps it will resolve to an approximate address.
If the food truck location api needs to convert an address request, it will send the request directly to the API and bing maps will resolve it with a LAT/LONG entry that then 
the Foodtruck API can search food trucks near the address entered by the user.
